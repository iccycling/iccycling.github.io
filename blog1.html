					<h3 class="major">New Website and a Vision for the Cycling Club</h3>
					<p><em>June 9, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>
					<span class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Insta-Preview.jpg" alt="ICCC Website Screenshot or Design Draft" />
					</span>






					<p>The new Imperial College Cycling Club website started as a prototype — a test of how quickly a
						modern website could be built using templates and tools like ChatGPT. What began as a technical
						experiment soon turned into a real club project, as the idea sparked interest and support within
						the cycling community.</p>

					<p>While initially a personal project, the website soon developed into a proper design and
						communication platform for the club. Beyond technical implementation, the work involved article
						writing, visual design, and some deeper thought about what role a club website should play —
						both functionally and as a reflection of club culture.</p>

					<p>Modern cycling culture is evolving, with strong influences from design, fashion, and lifestyle.
						This shift has been embraced by brands like Rapha, MAAP, and Pas Normal Studios. Inspired by
						that, the ICCC website was designed not just to be functional but to visually align with
						contemporary cycling aesthetics. The goal is to help ICCC present itself as an open, modern, and
						active part of Imperial’s student life.</p>

					<p>Club culture plays an important role at universities like Imperial. It helps build community,
						enriches student life, and offers continuity between generations of students. That’s why a
						strong online presence — from the website to social media — can make a real difference. It helps
						students discover the club, understand what it offers, and feel welcome.</p>

					<p>Despite the new website and growing visibility, the Imperial College Cycling Club (ICCC) still
						faces challenges that contribute to low member numbers. The club’s vision is to make cycling
						more accessible, grow membership, and develop a clear strategy for the future. The website acts
						as a first step in this process, providing a modern platform to showcase the club's activities,
						values, and opportunities.</p>

					<p>Importantly, the ICCC aims to attract not only students interested in BUCS road competitions, but
						also those who see cycling as a lifestyle, a balance to everyday life, or a sustainable form of
						city mobility. By combining a strong online presence with practical solutions for accessibility
						and engagement, the club hopes to connect with a wider community and strengthen its role within
						Imperial’s student life.</p>

					<p class="subheading">1. Communication and Appearance</p>

					<p>The club needs a stronger identity and better communication.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Accessible Information</strong><br>
						We have created a new website that highlights different aspects of cycling and makes information
						more accessible. It will serve as the main platform for news and club offers.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Style and Cycling Culture</strong><br>
						ICCC should present cycling more as a lifestyle topic, focusing on style and everyday cycling
						culture. At the moment, the club has no real design, a poor logo, and very little Instagram
						activity. This needs improvement.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Club Hoodie</strong><br>
						A new hoodie will make the club more visible on campus and strengthen identity.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Road Kit</strong><br>
						The current road kit is poorly designed. We want to create a new one with a modern pro team
						look. If
						needed, also an MTB jersey.</p>

					<p class="subheading">2. Storage and Bike Maintenance</p>

					<p>Most students live in small rooms with very limited space. This makes storing, repairing, or
						cleaning
						a bike a real challenge. Without these possibilities, cycling is hardly possible in London.</p>

					<p>• <strong>ICCC Bike Workshop</strong><br>
						We want to set up a workshop where members can clean and repair their bikes. The “Bike Users
						Group”
						had a workshop until last year – ICCC could take it over. A bike wash with hose and drainage
						should
						also be included.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Bike Storage</strong><br>
						It would be useful to offer bike storage by securing our own space, for example a shed in a
						campus
						bike parking area.</p>

					<p>• <strong>2 Club Hardtail MTBs</strong><br>
						The club should purchase two hardtail MTBs. These would give students the chance to try the
						sport if
						the high purchase price is holding them back. They would also help members who do not have
						storage
						space in London.<br>
						Hardtails are ideal as club bikes because they are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>versatile (good for MTB activities and also XC training, which is closely linked to road
							cycling),</li>
						<li>robust (no fragile carbon fork),</li>
						<li>easy to maintain,</li>
						<li>simple to handle,</li>
						<li>cheaper than other categories of bikes.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>They could, for example, be stored in the Faculty Building Bike Park. Club mountain bikes would
						also
						benefit exchange students who only stay in London for a short time and freshers who want to try
						cycling.</p>

					<p>To support this, the club could create a <em>Workshop and Materials Manager</em> position for a
						dedicated student to take responsibility for the workshop and club bikes.</p>

					<p class="subheading">3. Indoor Cycling</p>

					<p>The challenges of London life make cycling even harder: high rent, little space, far distances to
						nature, and academic terms from autumn to spring, which skip the main cycling season. Cycling
						also
						takes more time than, for example, a quick evening run in Hyde Park.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Indoor Cycling Offers</strong><br>
						We want to provide indoor cycling training so members can continue riding even in winter or with
						limited time.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Overview of Existing Indoor Bikes</strong><br>
						Together with Imperial Athletes, we should create an overview of where modern indoor bikes are
						available (e.g., Wattbikes in Ethos and Weights Club, Boat House, other gyms).</p>

					<p>• <strong>Expanding Capacity</strong><br>
						We should explore whether new indoor bikes can be purchased to expand capacity and where they
						could
						be placed.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Prioritised Access for ICCC Members</strong><br>
						It would be helpful to arrange reserved times or dedicated Wattbike access for ICCC members,
						possibly even without a full gym membership. Alternatively, ICCC could look for a room to place
						two
						Wattbikes exclusively for club use.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Existing Spinning Bikes</strong><br>
						We need to gather information about the existing spinning bikes:<br>
						– Are they suitable for indoor cycling training?<br>
						– Do they measure power (watts)?<br>
						– Can ICCC members access them outside of official spinning classes?</p>

					<p class="subheading">4. Cross-Club Endurance Sports Offers</p>

					<p>Currently, ICCC and the IC Triathlon Club sometimes compete with overlapping cycling offers. A
						partnership would make sense to strengthen both clubs.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Club Partnership: Joint Offers with Triathlon Club</strong><br>
						We could combine offers through cooperation: shared group rides, joint spinning sessions, and
						joint
						training opportunities.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Cross-Club Endurance Sport Support</strong><br>
						Under the umbrella of Imperial Athletes, different different offers could be made for endurance
						athletes:</p>

					<p>• <strong>Strength Training</strong><br>
						Provide strength training introductions for endurance athletes. Strength is an important part of
						cycling, and beginners should learn the correct techniques under guidance.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Nutrition and Training Seminars</strong><br>
						Offer seminars or online courses on nutrition and endurance training methods together with other
						Imperial Athletes clubs.</p>

					<p><strong>• Promoting the Benefits of Strength and Endurance Training</strong><br>
						A healthy mind lives in a healthy body. At university, physical activity is often neglected
						because the focus is heavily on academics. However, the benefits of sports are immense,
						improving both mental well-being and physical performance, which in turn supports academic
						success.</p>

					<p class="subheading">5. Clear Safety Concept</p>

					<p>Cycling has risks. Riders are exposed to traffic, accidents can happen, and mechanical failures
						are
						always possible. To make members feel safe, the club needs a clear safety strategy.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Insurance</strong><br>
						Provide information about useful insurance cover for cyclists.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Emergency Pickup</strong><br>
						Explore options for an emergency pickup service in case of accidents or breakdowns, to bring
						rider
						and bike home.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Road Safety</strong><br>
						Offer training and guidance on road safety for group rides and city cycling.</p>

					<p class="subheading">6. Alumni</p>

					<p>Many people only discover cycling after their university years. Alumni can bring valuable
						experience
						to group rides and strengthen the club community.</p>

					<p>• <strong>Alumni Engagement & Tierd Membership</strong><br>
						Develop strategies to better involve alumni and invite them to join rides or club activities.
					</p>

					<p>• <strong>Tiered Membership</strong><br>
						Introduce a tiered membership model that includes alumni and reflects the different activity
						levels
						within the club.</p>

					<p class="subheading">Conclusion</p>

					<p>The Imperial College Cycling Club has huge potential. With a clear vision, stronger
						communication,
						new equipment, indoor training, and collaborations, we can make cycling accessible to more
						students
						and grow our membership.</p>

					<p><em>Our goal is simple: show that ICCC is not just about racing, but also about lifestyle,
							community,
							and the joy of cycling.</em></p>

					<h3 class="major">Quick Guide: Creating Logos & Graphics for the Club</h3>
					<p><em>June 09, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>

					<p>
						If you’re working on the website or posting on social media and need graphics – no need to
						install anything or pay for software. Just use Photopea and Inkscape. They’re free and easy to
						learn.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Photopea</strong> runs in your browser and works like Photoshop. Perfect for quick
						designs. If you're creating a logo, <strong>export it as SVG</strong> so it scales cleanly.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Inkscape</strong> is a vector graphics tool. Great for logos, layouts, or clean scalable
						shapes. SVG is the standard format, and you can also export PNG or PDF.
					</p>

					<h4 class="major">Example: New ICCC Logo</h4>
					<p>
						The current logo was built in Photopea. Here's the structure:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Left side:</strong> “ICC” over three lines, Montserrat Extra Bold, 150px, italic
							“I”, letter spacing -10%, height 120%, width 110%</li>
						<li><strong>Right side:</strong> “Imperial”, “Cycling”, “Club” stacked, Montserrat Medium, 38px,
							letter spacing -20%, line height 47px</li>
					</ul>
					All in black and white, the round C’s were chosen to subtly echo two bike wheels — a simple but
					effective design. Alternatively, the ICCC logo with three C’s is also used. Opinions differ on
					whether two or three C’s are preferable.
					</p>

					<div class="box alt">

								</span>
							</div>



						</div>
					</div>


					<h4 class="major">Old Logo Still in Use</h4>
					<p>
						The older design with the Imperial crest and bicycle is still part of the club’s identity. We
						now treat it as our <strong>heritage logo</strong> – used for merch, events, or when we want to
						tap into tradition.

						<h3 class="major">Website Maintenance Guide</h3>
						<p><em>June 08, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>

						<p>
							Welcome! This guide helps you maintain and update the website easily. No prior deep
							knowledge
							needed, but some basic coding experience helps. Otherwise, learning by doing and asking
							ChatGPT
							is a great way forward.
						</p>

						<h4>About the Website</h4>
						<p>
							The website is built simply on a template from <strong>HTML5UP</strong> (big thanks for the
							awesome templates!).
							This ensures the site is <strong>responsive</strong> and works well on mobile devices.
							The simple structure also means <strong>easy maintenance</strong>.
						</p>

						<h4>General Tips for Maintenance</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Be <strong>careful when editing <code>main.css</code></strong> — usually, you don’t need
								to
								change much here. Small mistakes can cause layout problems.</li>
							<li>To <strong>add or update content</strong>, simply <em>copy &amp; paste existing
									sections</em> and modify them.</li>
							<li>Check out <code>elements.html</code> for an overview of available elements and how to
								use
								them.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Handling Images and Galleries</h4>
						<p>
							You can use <strong>Glightbox</strong> to make galleries swipeable and more user-friendly.
							See the example gallery below for how to implement it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Optimize image size and format to keep load times low and site performance smooth.
							If unsure, ask ChatGPT for advice on best image formats and sizes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Don’t overload the site with too many images.
							For photo projects, consider using <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Flickr</strong>, or
							similar platforms to showcase galleries externally.
						</p>

						<!-- Example Gallery -->
						<section>
							<h4>Example Gallery</h4>
							<p>
								If you use stock photos make sure they have a license that allows the usage. Unsplash is
								a
								good website to find free stock photos. Some of those stock photos can be found in the
								following gallery. (Thanks @jordphotography on Unsplash)

											</span>
										</a>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</section>

						<h4>Tools and Workflow</h4>
						<p>
							Install <strong>VSCode</strong> as your development environment. It’s free and
							beginner-friendly.
							Always <strong>test your changes locally in a browser</strong> before publishing online.
							Keeping
							Backups is as also an good idea.
						</p>
						<p>
							To keep blog pages manageable, after several posts create a new blog page like
							<code>blog4.html</code>, <code>blog5.html</code>, etc.
						</p>

						<h4>Final Note</h4>
						<p>
							I hope this website serves as a solid foundation for the club’s online presence and lasts
							for
							many years.
							Best regards!
