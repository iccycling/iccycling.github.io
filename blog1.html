					<h3 class="major">About the New ICC Website</h3>
					<p><em>June 9, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>
					<span class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Insta-Preview.jpg" alt="ICC Website Screenshot or Design Draft" />
					</span>

					<p>
						The new Imperial College Cycling Club website started as a prototype — a test of how quickly a
						modern website could be built using templates and tools like ChatGPT. What began as a technical
						experiment
						soon turned into a real club project, as the idea sparked interest and support within the
						cycling community.
					</p>


					<p>
						While initially a personal project, the website soon developed into a proper design and
						communication platform for the club. Beyond technical implementation, the work involved article
						writing, visual design, and some deeper thought about what role a club website should play —
						both functionally and as a reflection of club culture.
					</p>

					<p>
						Modern cycling culture is evolving, with strong influences from design, fashion, and lifestyle.
						This shift has been embraced by brands like Rapha, MAAP, and Pas Normal Studios. Inspired by
						that, the ICC website was designed not just to be functional but to visually align with
						contemporary cycling aesthetics. The goal is to help ICC present itself as an open, modern, and
						active part of Imperial’s student life.
					</p>

					<p>
						Club culture plays an important role at universities like Imperial. It helps build community,
						enriches student life, and offers continuity between generations of students. That’s why a
						strong online presence — from the website to social media — can make a real difference. It helps
						students discover the club, understand what it offers, and feel welcome.
					</p>

					<p>
						While the site is live, there's still potential for the club to grow — in terms of activity,
						communication, and outreach. Below are several suggestions to support this development.
					</p>

					<h4>Suggestions for Developing a New Chapter of ICC</h4>

					<p><strong>1. Clearer Communication of What the Club Offers</strong><br />
						More transparent and accessible information about rides, training opportunities, and general
						support services like Wattbikes, gym access, or coaching would help attract and retain members.
					</p>

					<p><strong>2. Cross-Club Endurance Sports Support</strong><br />
						Shared initiatives across endurance sports (e.g. supervised gym sessions, seminars on training
						methodology and recovery) could offer more value and create synergies between clubs.
					</p>

					<p><strong>3. Better Access to Indoor Training</strong><br />
						Easier and club-prioritised access to Wattbikes at Ethos, and ideally two club-owned Wattbikes
						stored in the Union building. Also: bike cleaning, storage, and repair options could improve the
						overall infrastructure.
					</p>

					<p><strong>4. Broader Appeal Through Modern Cycling Trends</strong><br />
						The club could reflect current cycling trends by promoting formats like indoor cycling, gravel,
						bikepacking, and urban commuting. These formats attract a more diverse and inclusive membership
						base.
					</p>

					<p><strong>5. Tiered Membership Model</strong><br />
						A low-barrier entry membership — especially free or symbolic for casual cyclists — can help the
						club grow and bring in people who may later get involved more deeply or compete.
					</p>

					<p><strong>6. Club-Owned MTB</strong><br />
						A club-owned hardtail MTB would give newcomers access to the sport. It would also support
						students who can’t afford or store a bike in London. A pilot purchase could cost ~£700 and be
						maintained by members with a small usage fee.
					</p>

					<p><strong>7. Alumni Strategy</strong><br />
						Many students only fully engage with cycling after graduation. A small alumni network could
						enrich the club with experience, mentoring, and even funding opportunities. It would also keep
						former students connected to the ICC community.

					<h3 class="major">Quick Guide: Creating Logos & Graphics for the Club</h3>
					<p><em>June 09, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>

					<p>
						If you’re working on the website or posting on social media and need graphics – no need to
						install anything or pay for software. Just use Photopea and Inkscape. They’re free and easy to
						learn.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Photopea</strong> runs in your browser and works like Photoshop. Perfect for quick
						designs. If you're creating a logo, <strong>export it as SVG</strong> so it scales cleanly.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Inkscape</strong> is a vector graphics tool. Great for logos, layouts, or clean scalable
						shapes. SVG is the standard format, and you can also export PNG or PDF.
					</p>

					<h4 class="major">Example: New ICC Logo</h4>
					<p>
						The current logo was built in Photopea. Here's the structure:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Left side:</strong> “ICC” over three lines, Montserrat Extra Bold, 150px, italic
							“I”, letter spacing -10%, height 120%, width 110%</li>
						<li><strong>Right side:</strong> “Imperial”, “Cycling”, “Club” stacked, Montserrat Medium, 38px,
							letter spacing -20%, line height 47px</li>
					</ul>
					All in black and white, the round C’s were chosen to subtly echo two bike wheels — a simple but
					effective design. Alternatively, the ICCC logo with three C’s is also used. Opinions differ on
					whether two or three C’s are preferable.
					</p>

										style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; object-fit: contain;" />
								</span>
							</div>



						</div>
					</div>


					<h4 class="major">Old Logo Still in Use</h4>
					<p>
						The older design with the Imperial crest and bicycle is still part of the club’s identity. We
						now treat it as our <strong>heritage logo</strong> – used for merch, events, or when we want to
						tap into tradition.

						<h3 class="major">Website Maintenance Guide</h3>
						<p><em>June 08, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>

						<p>
							Welcome! This guide helps you maintain and update the website easily. No prior deep
							knowledge
							needed, but some basic coding experience helps. Otherwise, learning by doing and asking
							ChatGPT
							is a great way forward.
						</p>

						<h4>About the Website</h4>
						<p>
							The website is built simply on a template from <strong>HTML5UP</strong> (big thanks for the
							awesome templates!).
							This ensures the site is <strong>responsive</strong> and works well on mobile devices.
							The simple structure also means <strong>easy maintenance</strong>.
						</p>

						<h4>General Tips for Maintenance</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Be <strong>careful when editing <code>main.css</code></strong> — usually, you don’t need
								to
								change much here. Small mistakes can cause layout problems.</li>
							<li>To <strong>add or update content</strong>, simply <em>copy &amp; paste existing
									sections</em> and modify them.</li>
							<li>Check out <code>elements.html</code> for an overview of available elements and how to
								use
								them.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Handling Images and Galleries</h4>
						<p>
							You can use <strong>Glightbox</strong> to make galleries swipeable and more user-friendly.
							See the example gallery below for how to implement it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Optimize image size and format to keep load times low and site performance smooth.
							If unsure, ask ChatGPT for advice on best image formats and sizes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Don’t overload the site with too many images.
							For photo projects, consider using <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Flickr</strong>, or
							similar platforms to showcase galleries externally.
						</p>

						<!-- Example Gallery -->
						<section>
							<h4>Example Gallery</h4>
							<p>
								If you use stock photos make sure they have a license that allows the usage. Unsplash is
								a
								good website to find free stock photos. Some of those stock photos can be found in the
								following gallery. (Thanks @jordphotography on Unsplash)

											</span>
										</a>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</section>

						<h4>Tools and Workflow</h4>
						<p>
							Install <strong>VSCode</strong> as your development environment. It’s free and
							beginner-friendly.
							Always <strong>test your changes locally in a browser</strong> before publishing online.
							Keeping
							Backups is as also an good idea.
						</p>
						<p>
							To keep blog pages manageable, after several posts create a new blog page like
							<code>blog4.html</code>, <code>blog5.html</code>, etc.
						</p>

						<h4>Final Note</h4>
						<p>
							I hope this website serves as a solid foundation for the club’s online presence and lasts
							for
							many years.
							Best regards!
