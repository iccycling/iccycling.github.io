						<h3 class="major">Which Bike Should You Choose as a Beginner?</h3>
						<p><em>June 16, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>

						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Blog/equipment/roadbike-2.jpg"
									alt="Roadbike" /></span>
							When you're new to cycling, it’s tempting to go straight for the sleek carbon bikes you see
							in races and ads. But here’s the truth: <strong>aluminum is your friend</strong> when you’re
							starting out.</p>

						<strong>Why Not Carbon?</strong>
						<p>Carbon frames offer incredible performance, no doubt. But carbon is a more brittle material
							and not ideal if you're still developing your handling skills or learning how to care for a
							bike. A crash, a fall, or even overtightening a clamp can damage a carbon frame.
							<strong>Modern aluminum frames</strong>, on the other hand, are excellent in quality, far
							more forgiving, and often cheaper.
						</p>

						<p><strong>Steel frames?</strong> They're charming and durable but heavy. Not ideal for road
							cycling or performance riding.</p>

						<p>Also, avoid bikes that are too old. Besides wear and tear, <strong>technology in bikes has
								evolved rapidly</strong>, making newer models safer, lighter, and more efficient.</p>

						<strong>Frame Size &amp; Setup</strong>
						<p>Getting the <strong>right frame size</strong> is crucial. A bike that’s too big or too small
							will be uncomfortable and inefficient. If in doubt, most major brands (like Canyon or Giant)
							offer <strong>online size calculators</strong>.</p>

						<p>One great example of a beginner-friendly setup is the <strong>Canyon Endurace AL with Shimano
								105</strong> – modern geometry, solid components, and a trusted manufacturer.</p>

						<strong>Buying on a Budget</strong>
						<p>If you're on a tight budget, here’s where you can safely save money:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Rim brakes</strong> instead of disc brakes</li>
							<li><strong>Quick-release wheels</strong> instead of thru-axles</li>
							<li><strong>Used bikes</strong> from trusted sellers</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Look for a used bike with:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A <strong>reputable brand</strong> (e.g., Canyon, Scott, Trek, Specialized, Giant, Cube,
								BMC, Cannondale, Ribble, etc.)</li>
							<li><strong>Aluminum frame</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Shimano 105 or Ultegra</strong> drivetrain (or SRAM equivalent)</li>
							<li><strong>Good condition</strong>, no cracks, rust, or worn-out drivetrain parts</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If you’re unsure, ask a knowledgeable friend to help evaluate the bike. Buying used without
							experience is risky, and what looks like a bargain can quickly turn into an expensive repair
							project.</p>

						<p>The good news: <strong>quality bikes hold their value well</strong>, so resale is always an
							option.</p>

						<strong>Road, Gravel, or MTB?</strong>
						<p>This is where many get stuck. So here’s a quick guide:</p>

						<strong>Endurance vs Race Road Bikes</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Endurance</strong> geometry is more relaxed and beginner-friendly.</li>
							<li><strong>Race</strong> geometry is aggressive and not ideal for long rides if you're not
								flexible or experienced.</li>
						</ul>

						<strong>Gravel Bikes</strong>
						<p>Gravel bikes are the trendy "do-it-all" machines. They ride well on tarmac, gravel, and light
							trails. Great for adventure, commuting, and training.</p>

						<strong>Hardtail MTB – The Sleeper Pick</strong>
						<p>For those on a tight budget or who want one bike for many uses, a <strong>hardtail mountain
								bike</strong> is a solid choice:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Robust and forgiving (no delicate carbon fork)</li>
							<li>Works for commuting, XC rides, gravel paths, and even mild trails</li>
							<li>Easy to find high-quality models at low prices, especially used</li>
							<li>Higher handlebar position = better visibility and control in traffic</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> heavier, less aerodynamic, and slower on group road rides. Still,
							a great way to start the sport without breaking the bank.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p><em>Personally, I’d pick a road bike or XC MTB over a gravel bike, but it’s really a
									lifestyle choice at the end of the day.</em></p>
						</blockquote>

						<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>
						<p>Buying a new bike is one of the most exciting parts of getting into cycling – but it’s easy
							to overthink. Go for a reliable, modern aluminum bike that fits your budget and riding
							style. Don’t get caught up in the hype around gear and accessories.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Essential Road Cycling Clothing and Where to Buy</h3>
					<p><em>June 16, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>
					<p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/Blog/equipment/cyle-outfit.jpg"
								alt="Early morning meetup" /></span>
						When hitting the road on your bike, having the right clothing is just as important as having the
						right bike – for comfort, safety, and performance. Here’s a quick guide on what you really need
						and where to find it.
					</p>

					</p>

					<h3>Helmet and Glasses: Safety First</h3>
					<p>
						The bike helmet is your most important safety accessory. Designs and technology have come a long
						way, making helmets both protective and stylish. Trusted brands like Abus, Kask, Rudy Project,
						Giro, and Specialized offer certified models. It’s important the helmet fits well, so buying
						from a specialist store is recommended. Used helmets are not advised due to material fatigue
						risks. You can usually find the production date inside the helmet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sport sunglasses protect your eyes and add style. Popular brands include 100% and Oakley. The
						key is good UV protection—cheap knock-offs can actually harm your eyes by causing pupils to
						dilate in the darkened lenses. For beginners, a simple sport or lab glasses like Uvex also work
						fine.
					</p>

					<h3>Clothing: Comfort for Long Rides</h3>
					<p>
						The bib shorts with padding are the core of cycling clothing, providing comfort on longer rides.
						Pair them with a breathable cycling jersey featuring handy rear pockets.
					</p>
					<p>
						For changeable weather, a lightweight rain jacket is recommended. Jackets with PTFE membranes
						are waterproof and breathable, but the material is controversial due to environmental concerns.
						We suggest opting for simpler jackets with PU coatings instead — less functional but more
						sustainable.
					</p>
					<p>
						For cooler days, baselayers or functional shirts are useful, for example from Decathlon Kipsta.
						You can also add long cycling tights, leg warmers, and warm long-sleeve jerseys or jackets.
						Gloves protect your hands from abrasions in summer and keep them warm in winter.
					</p>

					<h3>Cycling Shoes: Efficiency and Control</h3>
					<p>
						Once you’re beyond the beginner stage, you’ll quickly realize the importance of cycling shoes.
						Connected to clipless pedals (cleats), they allow for more efficient power transfer. The Shimano
						SPD-MTB system is a great choice for beginners since the shoes have tread, allowing you to walk
						comfortably off the bike.
					</p>

					<h3>Where to Shop?</h3>
					<p>
						Decathlon offers great value-for-money cycling clothing for beginners.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also find good deals on secondhand platforms like Vinted or Amazon. Just make sure to
						choose established cycling brands such as Castelli, Sportful, Nalini, Kalas, Craft, Etxeondo,
						Biehler, Assos, Alé, Gobik, Bioracer, Santini, dhb, Van Rysel, B'Twin, Triban and others —
						functionality is key.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Endurance training methods, recovery and nutrition</h3>
					<p><em>June 16, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>
					<p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/Blog/equipment/gym-unsplash.jpg"
								alt="Endurance training and nutrition" /></span>

						Thanks to the easy availability of heart rate tracking via smartphones and smartwatches, and
						GPS-based speed and distance tracking, the topic of training methods has gained significant
						traction over the past decades. Easier access to training data and know-how through platforms
						like YouTube has made it much more feasible for people to improve their performance and take
						their fitness to the next level. As a result, cycling and triathlon have become more popular
						than ever. <br><br>

						If you have any ambitions in endurance sports, it's well worth learning about training
						methodology and building your own training plan. ChatGPT and YouTube are both excellent starting
						points. Questions like “What is Zone 2, the thing everyone’s talking about?” or “Rest day or
						active recovery?” can now be answered easily. In the end, consistency is key. Don't get
						discouraged by setbacks or by others who may start at a higher fitness level. Progress takes
						time, and everyone’s starting point is different. <br><br>

						Collect experience: try out different training approaches, but also learn to listen to your
						body. The consistency will pay off — with better performance, improved mental clarity, natural
						mood boosts, stress relief, better health, a longer life expectancy, and even better looks and
						confidence. But sport follows the rule: less is often more. That might sound counterintuitive,
						as you’d think the hardest-working person always wins — but especially beginners tend to
						overtrain, which can lead to exhaustion, performance drops, or injury. <br><br>

						To avoid injury and support your progress, include strength and mobility training. Heavy
						compound lifts like squats and deadlifts can actually benefit endurance athletes too. It takes
						time to develop proper technique and body awareness here, but the long-term benefits are
						substantial. Resistance training is currently a hot topic, and for good reason — it’s incredibly
						beneficial for overall health. <br><br>

						Nutrition is just as important as training and recovery. After training, it's essential to
						quickly replenish your carbohydrate stores. Also make sure to fuel with enough carbs before and
						during workouts to sustain performance — fat burns in the fire of carbohydrates. Without carbs,
						your performance will drop quickly. <br><br>

						In general, avoid overly processed food and aim for a balanced diet with sufficient protein.
						Endurance athletes should eat a carb-rich diet: rice, pasta, bread, fruit, etc. Even high sugar
						intake can be beneficial for endurance athletes as long as it’s balanced with training.
						Nutrition is a complex field where each person must find what works for them. One quote from a
						TED Talk on YouTube stuck with me: “Only 50% of what’s said in nutrition science is true. The
						problem is, we don’t know which 50%.” <br><br>

						If you’re interested in training plans or methods, feel free to reach out. The New York Times
						(which Imperial students can access) also publishes great articles about running — many of which
						are relevant for cycling, too. <br><br>

						<strong>Beginner Training Plan:</strong><br>
						If you want to make real progress in endurance sports, you need volume to build your aerobic
						base. Aim for at least 3 sessions a week of Zone 2 training (around 1 hour each) doing a sport
						you enjoy — like cycling or running. Zone 2 means going at a conversational pace. Exact heart
						rate formulas aren’t that useful, as heart rate can vary a lot depending on the day — especially
						for beginners. <br><br>

						The most important thing is that you enjoy it and don’t overdo it. In the beginning, even 20
						minutes of cycling or running is enough to start adapting. Once you’ve built a base, interval
						training can be added to boost performance. Supplement with strength training and mobility work
						(like stretching or foam rolling). Most people find it difficult to follow a structured program
						alongside demanding studies — and that’s okay. Even a little bit of movement makes a big
						difference. You might have more time to focus on structured training later in life. <br><br>

						It’s also essential to have alternatives to outdoor cycling — like running or indoor cycling
						(see our indoor training section). This way, you stay flexible with your training, regardless of
						the weather, and can easily fit sessions into your day to reach your training goals.

					<h3 class="major">Is Bike Fitting Really That Precise?</h3>

					<span class="image left"><img src="images/Blog/equipment/jordan-0TPSP3L6RmA-unsplash.jpg"
							alt="expensive road bike" /></span>

					<p>In recent years, bike fitting has developed into a full-blown industry — often accompanied by
						bold claims that your bike must be set up with millimeter precision. But is this really true?
					</p>

					<p>We don’t think so. In fact, there are <strong>no universal reference points</strong> that could
						justify such surgical-level adjustments. Bike fit is highly individual and dynamic: you don’t
						ride in a lab — you ride on the road, adjusting your posture constantly, especially as fatigue
						sets in.</p>

					<strong>The Myth of Millimeter-Perfect Fit</strong></br>

					<p>Turn on any professional cycling race, and you’ll notice it: even the pros often sit slightly
						crooked or shift position as they tire. The idea that there is one “correct” static position
						doesn’t hold up in the real world. Instead, <strong>bike fit exists within a window</strong> of
						acceptable parameters — not a single point.</p>

					<p>That’s why, especially for beginners, it’s not worth spending large sums of money on an elaborate
						professional fitting. Your body needs time to adapt to cycling in general before an optimized
						fit can be meaningful. An exception might be for time trial setups, where extreme aero positions
						justify professional attention.</p>

					<strong>Practical Bike Fit Advice</strong></br>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Saddle angle:</strong> Keep it flat or slightly tilted forward. Avoid excessive tilt
							in either direction. Use a smartphone level app to measure.</li>
						<li><strong>Saddle height:</strong> Slightly too low is better than too high. A high saddle
							leads to hip instability and lost efficiency.</li>
						<li><strong>Knee over pedal axle:</strong> This is a very rough guideline and not a strict rule
							— listen to your body.</li>
						<li><strong>Sliding on the saddle:</strong> If you’re sliding forward or backward constantly,
							try adjusting saddle position accordingly.</li>
						<li><strong>Reach to the handlebar:</strong> If you feel overstretched, your frame might be too
							large — but sometimes a shorter stem is enough.</li>
						<li><strong>Handlebar drop (saddle-to-bar height difference):</strong> Beginners should keep it
							low — no more than 0–5cm initially.</li>
						<li><strong>Cleat position:</strong> Set them symmetrically and slightly farther back rather
							than too far forward.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Comfort Takes Time</strong></br>

					<p>Feeling uncomfortable at first is normal. You need to build proper pedaling technique and
						muscular adaptation. Indoor bikes (like Wattbikes at the gym) are a great way to practice form
						and make gradual changes.</p>

					<blockquote>
						Listen to your body. Small aches can be normal; sharp pain or numbness should never be ignored.
					</blockquote>

					<strong>Handling Discomfort</strong></br>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Saddle pain:</strong> If it’s on the sit bones, that’s usually harmless. Try
							different shorts, saddle shapes, or just give your body time.</li>
						<li><strong>Soft tissue pain:</strong> Be cautious. If there's no relief with adjustments, stop
							training and reassess.</li>
						<li><strong>Back or neck pain:</strong> This often reflects weak supporting muscles. Targeted
							strength training can help significantly.</li>
						<li><strong>Knee pain or other joint issues:</strong> These can have many causes — don’t
							hesitate to consult a physiotherapist if problems persist.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Can We Help You with Bike Fitting?</strong></br>

					<p>Absolutely. If you're just starting out, our cycling club can support you with basic bike setup
						advice — no overcomplication, just practical tips based on experience.</p>

					<p>Remember, <strong>comfort, adaptation, and consistency</strong> are more important than finding a
						“perfect” setting from day one. You and your bike will grow together.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Bike Washing, Maintenance & Care</h3>
					<p><em>June 16, 2025 · by Frederik Beck</em></p>
					<p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/Blog/equipment/wash-bike-unsplash.jpg"
								alt="Clean bike on a sunny day" /></span>
					</p>
					Let's face it—cleaning your bike is one of those tasks that often gets neglected, especially if
					you don’t have access to a hose or yard. If you're stuck in student housing without outdoor
					space, washing becomes tricky. One simple solution: limit your rides to dry days. This alone can
					significantly reduce how often you need to clean your bike.<br /><br />

					If you're unsure about how to wash your bike properly, we recommend checking out this <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DifcPmKyPYs" target="_blank">YouTube guide</a>.

					For cleaning, a basic all-purpose household cleaner will do the job. However, be extra careful
					around your disc brakes—getting any oil on them can ruin braking performance. <br /><br />

					Chain cleaning is a bit of a controversial topic. While degreasers will get your chain spotless,
					some argue they can strip away the internal lubrication. For lubrication, stick with a simple
					chain oil. Avoid heavy-duty products for very wet conditions — they contain Teflon, which is both
					environmentally unfriendly and messy. Once applied, it’s almost impossible to clean
					off.<br /><br />

					Other than that, you don’t need fancy care products. Less is often more.<br /><br />

					<strong>Maintenance & Repairs</strong><br />
					With a bit of mechanical intuition, most bike repairs can be done yourself. YouTube is full of
					great tutorials. While we can’t offer a full repair service,
					we’re always happy to offer advice or help if we can.<br /><br />
