						Join our vibrant Road Cycling group for weekly rides in the beautiful Richmond Park and
						surrounding areas.
						Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned rider, our rides offer the perfect blend of challenge,
						community, and fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						We meet every Wednesday afternoon for beginner-friendly laps and every Sunday for a longer ride
						— usually 50+ km at a steady pace of around 28–30 km/h.
						The routes vary but often include scenic rides out to Windsor or hillier terrain in Surrey, with
						a well-deserved long coffee break midway.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please bring your helmet, enough food and water for the ride, and a puncture repair kit. A road
						bike is required to join the rides.
						Membership is essential as it provides access to subsidised club kit and opportunities like a
						summer trip abroad.
					</p>

							We know cycling in London comes with its challenges — busy roads, limited storage for road
							bikes, unpredictable weather, and busy schedules.
							That’s why we also support indoor cycling as a flexible and effective way to keep fit.
						</p>
						<p>
							Whether you train on a smart trainer at home or use the Wattbikes at Ethos Gym
							on campus, our club is committed to expanding its indoor cycling offerings.
							Indoor cycling lets you train regardless of weather or daylight, provides consistent
							conditions, and fits easily into even the busiest days.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s also ideal for beginners without a road bike who want to build a solid endurance base.
							Tip: Use the Wattbikes at Ethos Gym and install the Wattbike app to track your performance —
							and share your rides with us in our Strava group!
						</p>
						<p>
							Alumni no longer living in London are warmly invited to join our indoor community as well.
							We hope to grow our indoor program further and welcome your ideas and support. Feel free to
							reach out with suggestions — or better yet, get involved and help us develop new offerings!
						</p>
